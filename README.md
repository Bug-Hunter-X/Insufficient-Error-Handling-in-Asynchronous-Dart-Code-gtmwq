# Insufficient Error Handling in Asynchronous Dart Code

This repository demonstrates a common error in Dart: insufficient error handling when working with asynchronous operations and external APIs. The code attempts to fetch data from an API, but it lacks robust error handling for various scenarios, such as network issues, invalid JSON responses, or missing fields in the JSON data.

The `bug.dart` file shows the flawed code. The `bugSolution.dart` file provides an improved version with better error handling.

## How to reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `bug.dart`.
3. Observe the lack of specific error messages when issues occur.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.dart` file demonstrates how to improve the code by:

* Handling `FormatException` during JSON decoding.
* Checking for null values before accessing fields.
* Providing more specific error messages.
* Using more appropriate error handling strategies for different types of errors.
